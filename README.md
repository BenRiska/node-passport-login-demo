# node-passport-login-demo
A simple login based app made with node, passport + mongodb

hello + welcome to my first "real" node project, something that can genuinely be used in a real life project.

here is essentially a template for any login based app, made with the following nodeJS dependencies;

- bcryptjs
- connect-flash
- ejs
- express
- express-ejs-layouts
- express-session
- mongoose
- passport
- passport-local

also includes nodemon as a dev dependancy.

feel free to use in any of your own projects.
